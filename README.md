### Description
This project is heavily based on [Node MCU 1.0](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit-v1.0).
Still it is not a fork or copy, it's just a reinterpretation of given schematic in a new board with several simplifications.
This boards takes less room (8x2.54mm) than the nodeMCU (10x2.54mm) or other popular adapter boards for ESP 7/12.

**WARNING!<br />
You can't use any PLS connector with current revision, while inner diameter of holes is 0.9 mm!<br />
Modify it before manufacturing!**
